# Overview

This section is aimed at helping you understand the process of preparing a virtual private server or virtual machine hosted on the cloud as a Rocket Pool node.

## Guides

[Selecting a Hosting Provider](./providers) shows several examples of popular hosting providers that other Rocket Pool node operators use to run nodes in the cloud.

[Preparing the Operating System](./os) walks you through the basic steps of installing and configuring the base Operating System on your machine to prepare it for life as a node.

::: tip NOTE
Note that you will need to use a remote service like SSH to use your machine; consult the [**Intro to Secure Shell (SSH)**](../ssh) guide if you need a tutorial on how to do this.
