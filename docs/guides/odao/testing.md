# Testing your Oracle DAO Node

Once your node is set up and you've joined the Oracle DAO, you should test it to ensure it's able to perform its duties properly.
The best way to do this is to have it build the Redstone rewards Merkle tree using Rocket Pool's `treegen` utility.

### treegen

`treegen` is a tool that can reproduce the entire rewards Merkle tree and accompanying artifacts for a previous rewards interval via your archive Execution and Consensus clients.
It can also "dry run" the current interval by pretending that it ended at the latest finalized epoch (at the time of running it) and producing a partial tree from the start of the interval up to that point.

::: tip TIP
For more information on the rewards tree itself and accompanying files, please visit [**the formal specification**](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/blob/master/Merkle%20Rewards%20System/merkle-tree-spec).
:::

`treegen` can be used as a standalone binary (currently only built for Linux systems, x64 and arm64) or as a Docker container.

If you would like to download the standalone binary, you can find it in the releases here: [https://github.com/rocket-pool/treegen](https://github.com/rocket-pool/treegen).
Usage instructions are included in the README there, but we'll cover some examples below as well.

The Docker container tag for it is `rocketpool/treegen:latest`.

## Building a Dry-Run Tree

For a first test, run `treegen` to generate a dry-run tree that calculates the tree from the start of the rewards interval to the latest (finalized) slot.
We'll use [the script](https://github.com/rocket-pool/treegen/blob/main/treegen.sh) included in the repository that leverages the Docker container to run it on the node machine itself for simplicity:

```shell
./treegen.sh -e http://localhost:8545 -b http://localhost:5052
```

::: warning NOTE
Note that this particular configuration requires you to expose the Execution Client and Beacon Node APIs through the Docker configuration - ensure you have both options enabled in the `rocketpool service config` TUI.
:::

This will test your clients' abilities to respond to queries in a timely fashion (e.g., if you are using a third-party service, this will be helpful to assess whether or not its query rate-limit is insufficient), but **will not test their Archive Mode capabilities**.
It will produce output like the following:

```

```

If this runs without error, it will generate the rewards tree artifacts and save them as JSON files in your working directory.
You are free to explore them and ensure their contents are sane, but as they are dry-run files, they aren't canonically stored anywhere for comparison.

## Building a Canonical Tree from a Past Interval

This next test is to replicate one of the complete trees from a past interval.
This will require archival access on both the Execution Layer and the Consensus Layer, so it will serve as a good test of both capabilities.

As of this writing, **Interval 2** is an ideal choice as it is far in the past () and involved the Smoothing Pool (which accounts for the largest computational load when calculating the rewards for the period).

Run `treegen` using the following command:

```shell
./treegen.sh -e http://<your archive EC url> -b http://localhost:5052 -i 2
```

Note that the **Execution Client URL** is different here: it _must be_ an Archive EC as the snapshot block for Interval 2 was far in the past.

::: warning NOTE
Depending on your client configuration, building this tree can take _hours_.
The Smartnode will give you status indicators about its progress along the way, as you can see in the example below.

The output will look like this (truncated for previty):

The key thing to look for here is this message at the end:

```

```

If you receive this, then your watchtower can build the tree correctly.

::: danger NOTE
While this proves you can build the tree, you _must_ ensure your Web3.Storage API token has been entered into the Smartnode's configuration so it can upload the resulting tree to IPFS.
